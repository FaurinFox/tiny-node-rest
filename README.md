# tiny-node-rest
Does a very specific thing i happen to need, that's it.

This was specifically for node v v16.16.0, so not the latest by any means. Shouldn't matter much though, given this whole thing is not meant to be used by anyone else than self, and NVM exists should this be run years to the future
